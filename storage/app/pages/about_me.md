![Patrick Stephan](/images/250/avatar.jpg)I am a self taught web developer. I enjoy programming web based applications and fiddling around with code. My focus is on PHP and back-end developing, but I can be a full-stack developer when the time calls for it. I love PHP (especially the Laravel Framework) and AngularJS.


I have worked for a couple different web development firms building websites and web applications for clients ranging from churches to car dealerships to taxidermies to steel factories to online service providers. I have also built (or co-built) several proprietary programs including several content management systems, a time-tracking program, a CRM, a task manager and others. I have also built a simple <a href="http://www.oldblackbook.net" target="_blank">Bible search program</a>.


I live in St Louis, Missouri. I am currently employed at <a href="http://www.blusolutions.com" target="_blank">Blusolutions</a>. I am the children's ministries director at the <a href="http://www.bethelbaptistchurchimperial.com" target="_blank">Bethel Baptist Church</a> (yep, I built that site). I am married to my best friend, Mandy. I am a hobbiest photographer. I like the outdoors. I love all kinds of food and am particularly fond of international cuisine; but I have weakness for gas station taquitos.


You can find me on LinkedIn, Twitter and Github or randomly at a Qdoba or Panera Bread in south St Louis or at <a href="http://www.lab1500.com" target="_blank">Lab1500</a>.


Oh... And I like to make soap. From scratch.
